It lies on Massachusetts Bay, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. The city proper has an unusually small area for a major city, and more than one-fourth of the total\u2014including part of the Charles River, Boston Harbor, and a portion of the Atlantic\u2014is water. With an area of 89.63 mi\u00b2 and a population of 694,583, it is a metro area that is very comparable with New York City, and also a city that harbors many prestigious universities. In this Project, I will be comparing the difference between New York City and Boston in the ways that they are similar and dissimilar to each other. Further, I will be exploring the neiborhood of Boston to see what location is the best for opening a brand new coffee shop.\n\n\nDemographic Info :https://www.britannica.com/place/Boston#/media/1/74844/97698\n\n\n#### Target Audience \n\n* For Those \n\n\n\n***\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/66/93866-050-64944EF0/Skyline-Boston.jpg\" >"
