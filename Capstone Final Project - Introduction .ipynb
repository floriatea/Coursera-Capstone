It lies on Massachusetts Bay, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. The city proper has an unusually small area for a major city, and more than one-fourth of the total\u2014including part of the Charles River, Boston Harbor, and a portion of the Atlantic\u2014is water. With an area of 89.63 mi\u00b2 and a population of 694,583, it is a metro area that is very comparable with New York City, and also a city that harbors many prestigious universities. In this Project, I will be comparing the difference between New York City and Boston in the ways that they are similar and dissimilar to each other. Further, I will be exploring the neiborhood of Boston to see what factors (location, venues..) impact the housing sales price in Boston.\n\n\nDemographic Info :https://www.britannica.com/place/Boston#/media/1/74844/97698\n\n\n#### Target Audience \n\n* For those who are deciding between living in NYC or Boston and are interested in exploring the neighborhood and the venues of Boston.\n\n\n\n***\n\n<#img src=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/66/93866-050-64944EF0/Skyline-Boston.jpg\" >"

Data Processing**\n\nIn this Project, I will be using Fouresqure API (Including location data and explore) and perform data cleaning based on the type of data used. \n\n* Since Boston has no \"Borough\", I will be only dealing with 23 offcial neighborhoods.\n\nsource used: \n        *https://www.boston.gov/neighborhoods*       \n        *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Boston*\n* For each neighborhood coordinate informarion, I used google map to pinpoint the location data respectivly. For Housing sales price, I used a housing retail website that breakdown each neighborhood house price. I then divided each one by their respective squre feet to get latest per square meter Housing Sales Price (HSP) Averages for each neighborhood in Boston. I collected all the above info and put them into a Excel Spreadsheet.\n\nsource used:\n        *http://realestate.boston.com/buying/2018/06/25/what-median-home-value-gets-you-in-boston/*\n\n#### To Search for a specific venue category\nE.X:\n> `https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/`**search**`?client_id=`**CLIENT_ID**`&client_secret=`**CLIENT_SECRET**`&ll=`**LATITUDE**`,`**LONGITUDE**`&v=`**VERSION**`&query=`**QUERY**`&radius=`**RADIUS**`&limit=`**LIMIT**\n>\n\n#### To Explore a Given Venue\nE.X:\n> `https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/`**VENUE_ID**`?client_id=`**CLIENT_ID**`&client_secret=`**CLIENT_SECRET**`&v=`**VERSION**\n\n***"
